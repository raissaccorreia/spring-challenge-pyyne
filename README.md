2) In-Memory key-value store with TTL (Time To Live)

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
I implemented the project based on supplied PDF with requirement, focusing on the functionality and syntax.

### General

#### Design

The application implements a simple MVC architecture, with a controller acting as view, a service, and a model one for each functionality.

#### Exception Handler

Exception-handling is managed locally in controllers. Improvement would be to leverage Spring global exception handlers.

### Stack

Implemented from scratch using a linked list and pointers.

### In-memory key-value storage with TTL

- Key-Value storage was implemented using a Concurrent Hash Map
- For TTL the Value field was used to store not only the content, but also an integer that holds the amount of time in seconds that the content will be available, or zero if it's
permanent, and also the timestamp of creation of that object.
- By comparing the timestamp with timestamp + ttl we know if the object is valid yet and should be excluded or not.
- Expired data is only purged if requested, there is no passive expiration implemented.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Clone the repository and run the application using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raissaccorreia/spring-challenge-pyyne
cd ./spring-challenge-pyyne
mvn spring-boot:run
```

For that, it's necessary to install the following pre-requisites.

### Prerequisites

- Java openjdk version "17.0.2"
- Apache Maven 3.6.3

I ran and developed the application on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS, here are the links to check for your environment.

[JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

```bash
apt install openjdk-17-jdk openjdk-17-jre
unzip apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip
tar xzvf apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz
```

### Running

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To run all the tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

To run tests from a specific class:

"LifoTests" are for the stack functionality
"DictTests" are for the key-value storage functionality

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=LifoTests
mvn test -Dtest=DictTests
```

The tests are implemented using JUnit 5, and are towards the service layer instead of controller, because they're unit tests. Controller tests are supposed to be integration ones.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Controllers use simple return values (strings, see below for details). Potential improvement to return more flexible JSON structures.

To make it more simple I added the Postman JSON export on the root of the project, with the name
"Hiring-Test-Spring.postman_collection.json"

### Stack

- Add to "hello" stack: http://localhost:8080/lifo?word="hello"

- Get from stack and also remove it: http://localhost:8080/lifo?word="hello"

#### Expected Returns for Stack

- Get from stack:
  - "Stack is empty" if stack is empty
  - "Value" if "Value" is found and removed from stack
  - "Error: Error Message" if an error occurs and fall into catch statement in controller

- Add from stack:
  - "Value" if "Value" is added to stack
  - "Error: Erro Message" if an error occurs and fall into catch statement in controller

### Key-Value Storage

- Add to storage, "name" as key and "larry" as value without TTL: http://localhost:8080/dict?key="name"&value="larry"
- Add to storage, "name" as key and "larry" as value with TTL of 10 seconds: http://localhost:8080/dict?key="name"&value="larry"&ttl=10
- Get from storage the value that has "name" as key: http://localhost:8080/dict?key="name"
- Remove from storage the value that has "name" as key: http://localhost:8080/dict?word="name"

#### Expected Returns for Key-Value

- Add to storage:
  - "Added: key = value without ttl" if "key, value" pair is added to storage without TTL
  - "Added: key = value with ttl seconds" if "key, value" pair is added to storage with TTL amount of seconds
  - "Error: Error Message" if an error occurs and fall into catch statement in controller

- Get from storage:
  - "Value" if "Value" is added to storage
  - "Word: value not found" if value is not found
  - "Error: Erro Message" if an error occurs and fall into catch statement in controller

- Delete from storage:
  - "Removed: value" if "value" is removed from storage successfully
  - "Fail to Remove: value" if "value" is not found
  - "Error: Erro Message" if an error occurs and fall into catch statement in controller
